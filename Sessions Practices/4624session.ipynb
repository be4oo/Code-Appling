    "### List comprehension\n",
    "\n",
    "Sure, here's a comprehensive overview of list comprehensions in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "**List Comprehension** is a concise way to create lists in Python. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` statement, then zero or more `for` or `if` statements. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the `for` and `if` statements which follow it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a list of squares for numbers from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "**With Conditional:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for item in iterable if condition]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return a new list for which the condition holds true.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "even_squares = [x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a list of squares for even numbers from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Nested List Comprehension:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression for sublist in outer_list for item in sublist]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return a new list by iterating over sublists in the outer list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "nested_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]\n",
    "flattened = [item for sublist in nested_list for item in sublist]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a flattened list from a nested list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If-Else Condition:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[expression_if_true if condition else expression_if_false for item in iterable]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return a new list that evaluates an expression based on a condition for each item in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "parity = [\"even\" if x % 2 == 0 else \"odd\" for x in range(10)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will create a list that labels numbers from 0 to 9 as \"even\" or \"odd\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, while list comprehensions can make code more concise, they can also make code harder to read if overused or if the comprehension is complex. Use them judiciously."
