## Opportunities

### What are opportunities?

  * Favorable circumstances for launching a product/service successfully
  * More than just business ideas
  * Requires external validation
  * Influenced by environmental factors

### What do we know about opportunities?

  * Entrepreneurs search for, identify, recognize, create, and act on opportunities

## Discovery vs. Creation

### Discovery Theory

  * Assumptions:
    * Opportunities exist independently of entrepreneurs (realist philosophy)
    * Entrepreneurs differ from non-entrepreneurs ex ante
    * Decision-making is risky

### Creation Theory

  * Assumptions:
    * Opportunities do not exist before entrepreneurs (evolutionary realist philosophy)
    * Entrepreneurs may or may not differ from non-entrepreneurs ex ante
    * Differences emerge over time
    * Decision-making is uncertain

## Connecting the Dots

  * Entrepreneurs identify patterns and perceive changes in various areas (technology, markets, social norms)
  * Interpretations are influenced by experience and background

## What now?

  * Both discovery and creation modes are important
  * Entrepreneurs connect the dots to find opportunities
  * Effectuation is a key approach
  * Modes can be used complementarily, sequentially, or simultaneously
  * Entrepreneurs can improve their ability to create and identify opportunities
